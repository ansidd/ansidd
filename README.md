### What I am upto!
I'm currently obsessed with the possibilities that Neural Networks are bringing to the world. How cool is it to generate your own art, especially when you wish you knew how to draw? Really cool is the right answer! Ask me about how I am using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to produce paisleys and birds!


### Machine Learning Streak 🏋🏻
I dabbled in many fun projects right from 2015 when I first started college to the present day. During this time I found my self gravitating towards Machine Learning and its applications in various fields. I've used SVMs for image classfication, regression models for predicitng drug responses, neural networks to tell if a speaker is angry or not, NLP techniques to form knowledge graphs, facenet for face recognition, dual encoders for video search and now GANs for generating ART. These are projects in just my ML streak. 

### Polyglot I am 💪🏽
My native tongue is Python but I'm also fluent in Javascript, Java and C/C++
